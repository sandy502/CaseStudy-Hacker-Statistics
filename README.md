# CaseStudy-Hacker-Statistics

## 1. Load in the Data
- The code imports packages you used in Intermediate Python: NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. 
- The code also imports data you used in the course as DataFrames using the pandas [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function.

## challenges:

- Create a loop that iterates through the brics DataFrame and prints "The population of {country} is {population} million!".

- Create a histogram of the life expectancies for countries in Africa in the gapminder DataFrame. Make sure your plot has a title, axis labels, and has an appropriate number of bins.

- Simulate 10 rolls of two six-sided dice. If the two dice add up to 7 or 11, print "A win!". If the two dice add up to 2, 3, or 12, print "A loss!". If the two dice add up to any other number, print "Roll again!".
